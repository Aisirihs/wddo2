Jackpot assignment:
----------------------------
mkdir jackpot
mkdir jackpot/dir{1..100}
touch jackpot/dir{1..100}/file{1..100}

(we want to create one file named sunny.txt in some random directory)

[shuf command: 
shuf -i 1-100 -n 1
49  -->one random no. we get

shuf -i 1-100 -n 2
38
45   --> to random no.s it will generate ]

touch jackpot/dir$(shuf -i 1-100 -n 1)/sunny.txt
[ if we need to find in which directory sunny.txt file got created)
find jackpot -type f -name 'sunny.txt'
[if we need to find sunny.txt n move to desktop]
find jackpot -type f -name 'sunny.txt' -exec mv {} ~/Desktop \;

[delete all 100 directories present in jackpot including jackpot]
find jackpot -type d -exec rmdir {} \;
____________________________

to find only directories inside /dev folder n limit its search to only 2 levels of depth?
Ans-  find /dev -maxdepth 2 -type d

To find only files starts fom root directory where file name ends with .txt
Ans- find / -type f -name '*.txt'

To find all files n directory inside /dev directory upto max. 3 levels of depth n size> 200 kb
Ans- find /dev -maxdepth 3 -size +200k

Which command will find all files below home directory where file size > 3mb and remove all those files
find ~ -type f -size +3M -exec rm {} \;

difference b/w find and locate commands

______________________________________________
Search multiple content in a file with the help of egrep

grep -e 'java' -e 'linux' demo.txt

instead of -e option, we can use egrep command

egrep '(java|linux)' demo.txt

egrep -i '(java|linux)' demo.txt  ==>either java or linux

*egrep can understand that['(java|linux)' ] pattern. but grep cant
*grep can understand some patterns but not all

grep -i '^the' demo.txt    --> to search where it starts with 'the' (both upper or lower)
^a   -->starts with a
______________________________________
grep with -F option

-F   - serach for a group of fixed strings

grep -F "java
>linux
>python" demo.txt

searching for java,linux,python inside demo.txt

*instead of -F option, we can use fgrep command
fgrep -Fixed String Global Regular Expression Print
*fgrep can't understand patterns

--------------------------------------------------------------
fgrep -f option

fgrep -f file1.txt

_________________________________________________
it is recommended to use grep -F., grep -e coz egrep,fgrep are depricated in most unix flavours
